# Fabric MCP Server tool selection prompts

These prompts validate tool selection. They do not imply that live Fabric calls, real OBO authorization, or recorded playback have been exercised.

`none` means the prompt supplies the inputs needed for invocation, not that permission to mutate resources has been granted. Workspace creation and updates require separate authorization for live tests; offline tests substitute HTTP and credentials. Standard mutation confirmation still applies. The resource UUIDs below are examples, not provisioned test resources.

These prompts describe tool selection, not live test execution. Delete Item is tested only with mocked Fabric HTTP responses; never execute these destructive prompts against real Fabric during development or testing. Live Fabric, real OBO authorization, and recorded playback have not been exercised for this tool.

Delete Workspace likewise uses substituted HTTP and credentials only. Its prompts describe deletion of the specified workspace and the items under it, not authorization to execute a real deletion.

For every deletion prompt, explain the scope and request consent before sending one request. Omitted or false `hard-delete` uses the default behavior, with soft deletion dependent on item-type support; do not promise recovery or fall back to permanent deletion. Explicit true requests permanent deletion, which cannot be recovered and requires workspace Admin. Workspace deletion includes its items; do not promise recovery or permanent-deletion semantics, and do not prefetch, delete items individually, retry, or poll.

Workspace capacity assignment changes a live resource. Use only with an explicitly approved workspace, capacity, and identity; do not run these assignments as automated development checks.

`context-required` means the caller must supply the required resource context and authorization. Sections and tool names are sorted alphabetically.
