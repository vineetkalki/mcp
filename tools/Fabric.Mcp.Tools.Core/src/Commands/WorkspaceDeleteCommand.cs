        Deletes one Microsoft Fabric workspace AND the items under it. This is a destructive operation.
        Requires the explicit workspace UUID; workspace names and automatic target selection are not supported.
        The caller must have the Admin workspace role; delegated callers also need Workspace.ReadWrite.All.
        Returns the targeted workspace ID and a deletion acknowledgement only after Fabric reports successful completion.
        Does not enumerate or individually delete items, retry automatically, or poll.
